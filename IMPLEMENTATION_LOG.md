## Example Entry

### 2024-01-15 - Chunking - Modified Overlap Strategy
**Original Plan:** Fixed 10% overlap for all chunking strategies
**Actual Implementation:** Dynamic overlap based on chunk size (5-15%)
**Reason:** Fixed 10% created too much redundancy for small chunks, too little for large ones
**Impact:** Updated `splitIntoChunks` interface to accept `overlapRatio` range
