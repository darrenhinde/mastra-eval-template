# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Applications

AI and machine learning are used in:
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis
